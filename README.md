This project is to look into the life expectancy at birth (in years) of ten countries and the healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth (in years) along with the population using at least basic drinking water services percentages and population using at least basic sanitation services percentages. 

We picked the ten countries using a google search result to find out the 10 overall best countries and found that the United States was #7. Thus, we used the 7 best countries and selected three from the 10 worst countries. 

Through this project and graphs presented, we are able to analyze how the life expectancy years align with drinking water and sanitation to find out if our hypothesis that drinking water and sanitation does in fact correlate to a healthy life expectancy.

We think that it is good to be reminded of how the basic services in life help us live a better and healthier life compared to those less fortunate and developed countries. 

Definition: Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE)

It adjusts overall life expectancy by the amount of time lived in less than perfect health. This is calculated by subtracting from the life expectancy a figure which is the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a weighting to represent the effect of the disability.
